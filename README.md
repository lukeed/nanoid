#### USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

This has been forked from [`ai/nanoid`](https://github.com/ai/nanoid) **purely** for ESM imports & exports.<br>
The majority of `nanoid`'s features have been also been removed.<br>

> **Important:** This fork will change according to _my_ needs and **will not be maintained** for public use!

#### Still here?

Seriously, go use [`nanoid`](https://github.com/ai/nanoid) instead :laughing: It's great!
